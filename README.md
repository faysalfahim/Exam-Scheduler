## Exam-Scheduler
Exam-Scheduler is a project designed to facilitate the scheduling of exams. It offers an efficient way to organize and manage exam timetables for Ruet backlog exams, which are mainly for students who failed to clear the exams in one go. So in the case of logic building in this project, schedules are handled in a way that one student can sit for a maximum of 3 exams with a minimum conflict of dates (maximum 3 for a student) in a span of 7 days. For handling the data, this application takes a csv file of students who register for backlog exams and then sorts them out with maximum occurrences to prioritize the exams that are to be scheduled first so that more students can attend the exam.
